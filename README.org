And with that in mind I'm uploading my take at the exercises from Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs (SICP).

They are not beautiful, they are not perfect, but they are my take at them; I hope they are useful to someone.

From a selfish point of view, putting them out in public and showing that I'm working through them is also a way to held me accountable and finish the book (my second try at it).

Anyway, after this disclaimer, here we go.
